# Struct_Students


The task was to:
Create a program that allows you to implement the solution of the task using structures and unions. All input data is taken from a text file (create at least ten corresponding records in the file). Data input and output and other separate logical actions must be implemented in separate functions. In the main function, you need to perform only their call. The use of global variables is not allowed. Information should be passed to functions only through parameters. 

The information of the students of the group is recorded: Name and initials, address and phone number. In the absence of a phone number, there are spaces in the column corresponding to this information. Create a program that will print the phone number of the desired student, and in the absence of a phone, his or her address.
